# Utility tool to retrieve data from Toggl application

Personal util used to retrieve data from https://track.toggl.com by REST API. Its primary purpose is to generate a weekly report on how much time I spend on technical tasks (programming and code review) and how much on other things like management, support, documentation writing, etc.
